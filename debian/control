Package: strcase-dev
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Section: libdevel
Description: Multiway branch (switch) for short strings in C
 strcase (or strcase_tolower) can be used in the expression of a switch
 statement to convert a string to an integer type, STRCASE generates  at
 compile time the integer constants for the case stanzas of the switch.

Package: libstropt-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libstropt0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: parse options from a string (supports quotation, option arguments)
 This small library parses a list of options from a string. Options can
 be separated by spaces, commas, semicolons, tabs or new line.  Options
 may have arguments.  It is possible to protect symbols and spaces using
 quote, double quote and backslash.

Package: libvpoll-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libvpoll0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description:  generate synthetic events for poll/select/ppoll/pselect/epoll
 This library uses eventfd/VPOLL if provided by the kernel otherwise
 it  implements an emulator (providing only `EPOLLIN`, `EPOLLOUT` and a non
 standard version of EPOLLHUP/EPOLLRDHUP).

Package: libvolatilestream-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libvolatilestream0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description:  stdio stream as volatile memory buffers
 A volatile stream is a stdio FILE* stream as a temporary dynamically
 allocated (and deallocated) memory buffer.
 The volstream_open function opens a stdio stream as a temporary memory
 buffer. The buffer is dynamically  allocated, grows as needed and it is
 automatically deallocated when the stream is closed.
